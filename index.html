  <h2>Earth FAQ</h2>
  <h4>What is the Earth?</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank"><br>Source</a></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How fast is the Earth's rotation at Tucson, AZ?</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Tucson’s latitude is about 32.1 degrees. So, while the speed at the equator is about 1038 miles/hour at the equator, it is about 879 miles/hour at the latitude of Tucson. <br> <a href="https://www.psi.edu/epo/faq/earth.html" target="_blank">Source</a>

  </ul>

  <h4>Does time of day (23 hr 56 min) ever fluctuate +/- minutes based on Earth’s activity?</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Major earthquakes have altered the length of the day by only microseconds. However, over time, there is a bigger effect—tides. The Earth rotates in one day and the Moon orbits in 27.3 days. Think of the Earth spinning with the Moon raising tides.
      What do you get? Friction. What does this friction do? It slows down the Earth. However, angular momentum needs to be conserved (think of a spinning skater bringing in her/his arms, she/he spins faster). Therefore, the angular momentum of the slowing
      Earth is transferred to the Moon—the Moon moves away from the Earth. Is this measurable? Yes! The astronauts left mirrors on the Moon for scientists to bounce laser light. They have measured that the Moon is moving away from us at a rate of 3.8
      centimeters a year. This is consistent with the measurement that the Earth is slowing down by about 2.3 milliseconds per century. This may not seem like much, but scientists have looked at tidal deposits from 620 million years ago and find that
      the day was about 22 hours long and the Moon revolved around the Earth in 6% less time (it was closer) than it does now. <br> <a href="https://www.psi.edu/epo/faq/earth.html">Source</a>
